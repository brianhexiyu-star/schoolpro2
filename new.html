        <h2>Story Summary</h2>
        <p>
            In this story, Snow White is living peacefully in the forest when the Evil Queen plots once again to trick her with a poison apple. However, this time the modern world is connected to the fairy-tale world, and Iron Man detects unusual energy signals coming from the Queen’s laboratory. Curious and concerned, he investigates and discovers that Snow White is in danger. Using his advanced suit sensors, he locates her just moments before she takes a bite of the poisoned apple. Iron Man quickly scans the apple and identifies the dangerous chemical inside it. He uses a small neutralizing device from his suit to dissolve the poison safely. After saving her, he teaches Snow White how modern technology can help protect her from future tricks. Together, they come up with a plan to keep the forest safe using drones and alert systems so the Queen can never harm her again.
